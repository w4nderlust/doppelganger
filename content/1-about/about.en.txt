Biography: Being a curious mind searching for ways to bring together his different cultural interests, I am very fascinated by the interconnections between **knowledge**, **language** and **learning**. I love to search for non-obvious solutions to problems, following a **multidisciplinary approach** in order to learn new and diverse things and have new experiences. I developed strong technical skills in different fields of artificial intelligence and I am willing to apply them to challenging and interesting problems
